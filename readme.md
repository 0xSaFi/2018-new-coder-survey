This is the open dataset from freeCodeCamp's 2018 survey of more than 30,000 developers.

## The data

You can [read more about last year's 2017 survey here](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/take-the-2017-new-coder-survey-and-help-us-build-a-massive-public-dataset-8c808cbee7eb), along with [some survey statistics](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969).

You can [discuss these datasets in freeCodeCamp's Data Science Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/DataScience).

As of December 19, 2018, only the raw CSV dump has been uploaded (exported directly from Typeform). Here's the full survey dataset: [2018-new-coder-survey.csv](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey/blob/master/raw-data/2018-new-coder-survey.csv).

The cleaned up and combined data set will eventually be available in the `clean-data/` directory. Soon you will be able to check out the scripts we used to clean the data set in the scipts directory.
